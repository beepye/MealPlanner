# MealPlanner

A meal planning app (in progress) that will allow you to upload meals and create weekly meal lists based upon those existing meals.

Currently lives [here](http://www.thebrianpye.com/MealPlanner/).

#### Local CLI commands:
- `npm run build`: compiles and builds index.js into dist/main.js
- `npm run watch`: watches for index.js changes and auto reloads main.js
- `npm run scss`: compile sass to css
- `npm run server`: launch local webpack server
